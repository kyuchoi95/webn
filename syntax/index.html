          <strong>Netflix, Inc.</strong> is an American over-the-top content
          platform and production company headquartered in Los Gatos,
          California. Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc
          Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's primary business
          is a subscription-based streaming service offering online streaming
          from a library of films and television series, including those
          produced in-house. As of October 2020, Netflix had over 195 million
          paid subscriptions worldwide, including 73 million in the United
          States. It is available worldwide except in the following: mainland
          China (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due
          to US sanctions). It was reported in 2020 that Netflix's operating
          income is $1.2 billion. The company has offices in France, the United
          Kingdom, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Japan, and South Korea.
          Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), producing
          and distributing content from countries all over the globe.
