      <strong>The Crusades</strong> were a series of religious wars initiated,
      supported, and sometimes directed by the Latin Church in the medieval
      period. The term refers especially to the Eastern Mediterranean campaigns
      in the period between 1096 and 1271 that had the objective of recovering
      the Holy Land from Islamic rule. The term has also been applied to other
      church-sanctioned campaigns fought to combat paganism and heresy, to
      resolve conflict among rival Roman Catholic groups, or to gain political
      and territorial advantage. The difference between these campaigns and
      other Christian religious conflicts was that they were considered a
      penitential exercise that brought forgiveness of sins declared by the
      church. Historians contest the definition of the term "crusade". Some
      restrict it to only armed pilgrimages to Jerusalem; others include all
      Catholic military campaigns with a promise of spiritual benefit; all
      Catholic holy wars; or those with a characteristic of religious fervour.
