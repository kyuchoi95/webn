          <strong>The Trial of the Chicago 7</strong> is a 2020 American
          historical legal drama film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin. The
          film follows the Chicago Seven, a group of antiâ€“Vietnam War protesters
          charged with conspiracy and crossing state lines with the intention of
          inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
          It features an ensemble cast that includes Yahya Abdul-Mateen II,
          Sacha Baron Cohen, Daniel Flaherty, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael
          Keaton, Frank Langella, John Carroll Lynch, Eddie Redmayne, Noah
          Robbins, Mark Rylance, Alex Sharp, and Jeremy Strong.

          Sorkin originally wrote the screenplay in 2007, with the intent of
          Steven Spielberg directing the film with mostly unknown actors. After
          the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike and budget concerns forced
          Spielberg to drop out as director, Sorkin was announced as director in
          October 2018, and much of the cast joined that same month. Filming
          took place in the fall of 2019 in Chicago and around New Jersey.
