          <strong>Argo</strong> is a 2012 American historical drama thriller
          film directed by Ben Affleck. Screenwriter Chris Terrio adapted the
          screenplay from the 1999 book by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
          operative Tony Mendez, The Master of Disguise, and the 2007 Wired
          article by Joshuah Bearman, "The Great Escape: How the CIA Used a Fake
          Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran". The latter deals with
          the "Canadian Caper", in which Mendez led the rescue of six U.S.
          diplomats from Tehran, Iran, under the guise of filming a science
          fiction film during the 1979â€“1981 Iran hostage crisis.

          States on October 12, 2012. It was produced by Grant Heslov, Affleck
          and George Clooney.
