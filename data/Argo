  <strong>Argo</strong> is a 2012 American historical drama thriller film
  directed by Ben Affleck. Screenwriter Chris Terrio adapted the screenplay from
  the 1999 book by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency operative Tony Mendez,
  The Master of Disguise, and the 2007 Wired article by Joshuah Bearman, "The
  Great Escape: How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from
  Tehran". The latter deals with the "Canadian Caper", in which Mendez led the
  rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, under the guise of filming a
  science fiction film during the 1979â€“1981 Iran hostage crisis.
