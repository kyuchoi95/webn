  <strong>The Trial of the Chicago 7</strong> is a 2020 American historical
  legal drama film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin. The film follows the
  Chicago Seven, a group of antiâ€“Vietnam War protesters charged with conspiracy
  and crossing state lines with the intention of inciting riots at the 1968
  Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It features an ensemble cast that
  includes Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Sacha Baron Cohen, Daniel Flaherty, Joseph
  Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, John Carroll Lynch, Eddie
  Redmayne, Noah Robbins, Mark Rylance, Alex Sharp, and Jeremy Strong.

  Sorkin originally wrote the screenplay in 2007, with the intent of Steven
  Spielberg directing the film with mostly unknown actors. After the 2007
  Writers Guild of America strike and budget concerns forced Spielberg to drop
  out as director, Sorkin was announced as director in October 2018, and much of
  the cast joined that same month. Filming took place in the fall of 2019 in
  Chicago and around New Jersey.
